# NICE-KLMS-QkLMS and transfer learning
An implementation to "Transfer Learning in Adaptive Filters: The Nearest Instance Centroid-Estimation Kernel Least-Mean-Square Algorithm" with additional work on blood pressure prediction.
For additional detail please connect me on linkedin.
The pupose of this work was:

1- Implementation of KLMS, QKLMS, NICE-KLMS, NICE-QKLMS on two time series

2- Effect of transfering on target signal of Lorenz and Macky-glass time series and blood pressure of 60 cases

3- Advantage and disadvantage of transfering

4- How, when and why we can use transfering 

5- Using transfer learning in lack of data

6- Using transfer learning for increasing accuracy

7-...
